# **Poketext**
## *A text based Pokémon game*
This project is an attempt in creating a text based RPG Game, more especifically Pokémon. It uses 2D Matrices and random number generators to create a map with collidable walls as well as soundtrack based on the original game series.

>**Disclaimer:** Game still runs very glitchy, so don't expect for everything to be working at 100%.
